# StudyNotes-HTML-CSS

A clean, customizable HTML/CSS template for creating elegant study notes with support for code blocks, equations, and citations.

## Why?

I actually prefer taking notes using LaTeX, but sometimes it's just overwhelming to style your notes in it. This template is designed to make it easy to create clean, elegant notes. It's not meant to be used while taking notes in class, but rather to create a polished, organized version of your notes after finishing a lecture or reading a textbook. If you think this whole project is a crime against humanity, I agree. But I hope it's at least not as painful as debugging LaTeX errors at 3 AM.

## Features

- Responsive layout (should work for mobile devices)
- Customizable color scheme
- Support for code blocks with syntax highlighting
- LaTeX equation rendering
- Citation system with footnotes
- Flexible layout components (2-column, 3-column, 2x2 grid)
- Media component with caption and title
- Customizable panels with icons
- Page size is set to A4 for easy printing (Using extensions like SingleFile and an HTML to PDF converter)
- Since it is a static HTML/CSS template, it can be easily hosted on GitHub Pages or similar services
